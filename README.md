# Opn Front-end Code Challenges

**Opn**'s front-end code challenges are housed in this repository. These are tiny hands-on projects that are directly related to the things you'll be working on here.

## Ground Rules

* We favor well-thought-out ideas over quick-and-dirty answers. So, if you need it, take your time.
* Please send your project repo to your contact person through email for a take-home assignment.
* Do not distribute your solution via GitHub or any other public source repository.

## What to expect

We recognize that our coding challenges are time-consuming and not always simple to complete. We appreciate the time and work that candidates put into their applications. Our code challenges are designed to simulate some tasks and skills you'll need while working with us. We think that these tasks will provide you with a better knowledge of our product, what you will be working on in the future, and what degree of dedication we expect from candidates.

## What we look for

Rather than a complicated solution with a million features and 10,000 lines of code, we seek for:

* **Clarity:** You can write clear code that any devs could read and understand in one go.
* **Simplicity:** You can write gimmick-free and straightforward code with no ambiguities.
* **Defensiveness:** You can cover edge cases and treat user inputs with care.
* **Don't repeat yourself:** You can reduce repetition of software patterns to avoid redundancy.

## What happens after your submission

Our engineers will review the code. Due to the number of submissions we receive and the time-intensive review process, it might take us 1-week to give you feedback on the submission. Based on the feedback, if you did the take-home assignment, we will invite you for a meeting to present more about your submission and continue a technical interview.

## Challenges

You have 2 choices:

1. Take-home assignment replicate how software development actually happens. You can use tools of your choosing, you get to do so in an environment you’re comfortable in, and you get to do it on the schedule that works for them.

2. Live-coding session is a real-time face-to-face engagement with interviewers during which you may demonstrate your coding abilities using your preferred code editor. We have an incomplete project that we will let you finish on time (around 2 hours).

### Have fun and we look forward to your submission
